    "Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer. According to the Victoria department of health, over 95% of skin cancers that are dected early can be successfully treated. This means that early detection is a crucial step in the treatment process of skin cancer. In our analyses, we aim to identify different types of skin conditions with image classification techniques. Using convolutional neural networks (CNN) and logistic regression (LR) models, we obtain a 75% accuracy rate for classification, where melanocytic nevi (NV) and melanoma (MEL) are the most successfully classified forms of skin condition.\n",

    "### Introduction\n",
    "*Your introduction should describe the big-picture problem that you aimed to address in your project. What’s the problem to be solved, and why is it important? Who has tried solving this problem already, and what did they do? I would expect most introductions to reference no fewer than 2 scholarly studies that attempted similar tasks, although 5 is probably a better target.*\n",

    "In 1994, Binder et al. trained a neural network that successfully differentiated between melanomas, the leading cause of skin cancer deaths, and melanocytic nevus, which and generally harmless skin lesions commonly known as moles or birth marks. In 2018, a challenge hosted by the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) lay out the task of detection and classification of skin lesions and diseases. 900 parties registered to download the data for the challenge and hundreds of group submitted novel evaluation techniques to automate the process of diagnosing skin lesions and diseases. A study conducted on the ISIC challenge revealved that the best classification models still failed to properly classify on average over 10% of dermoscopic images and had varying abilities to generalize (Coedlla et al., 2019). As it turns out, Binder et al.'s study (1994) trained their neural network on 200 images. The dataset used by the ISIC challenge is the world's largest public repository of dermoscopic images of skin and contains 10015 dermoscopic images. First released in 2018 by Philipp Tschandl et al. the HAM10000 (Humans Against Machines) is a novel dataset of  with the aim of improving the process of automated skin lesion diagnosis. \n",
    "\n",
    "According to a recent study by Tandon et al. (2024), the most successful model implemented to automate the diagnoses of cancer patients is the convolutional neural network (CNN). CNNs are a type of neural network that are particularly effective for identifying patterns in images and audio. CNNs are best used when there are large amounts of data to train the model on. Before the release of the HAM10000 dataset, the diversity and size of dermatoscopic images was limited, which also limited the progression of automated skin lesion detection (Tschandl et al. 2024). Binder et al.(1994) creates a model from a much smaller sample size and is limited in the diversity of skin lesions it can detect. As revealed by the 2018 ISIC challenge, automated healthcare diagnoses are still limited in accuracy and generalizability.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our project, we apply our knowledge of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and other machine learning techniques to the HAM10000 dataset with the goal of classifying types of skin lesions. Accurate and early skin lesion diagnosis is crucial to a successful recovery when it comes to skin cancer.  Melanoma, a type of skin cancer, is quick to spread to other organs, and is the leading cause of deaths due to skin cancer. But when detected early enough, before the melanoma has a chance to spread, melanoma has a five-year survival rate of 98%. As seen in Figure 1, the majority of skin lesions in the HAM10000 dataset are melanocytic nevi (NV), and the second most common skin lesions are melanomas (MEL). **ABCDE!!!! include this from Fred Hutch!!!**\n",
    "\n",
    "We use CNN and logistic regression models to classify types of skin lesions identified in the HAM10000 dataset. Using the logistic regression models on non-image variables provided in the dataset, we achieve a testing accuracy of 68%. Including images when training the model does not significantly increase the accuracy rate. When using the CNN method, we apply class weights as the dataset is highly imbalance towards NV diagnoses. **This results in a model with 75% testing accuracy**. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also separate skin lesion types into 'malignant' and 'benign' categories. When training to classify more dangerous skin lesions from harmless skin lesions, we find an accuracy of **______** in out model.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the imbalanced dataset made the methods we used more difficult to train to achieve higher accuracy than baseline, we believe these models are generalizable as the majority of skin lesions are melanocytic nevi, which is reflected in the dataset. Additionally, our findings from malignant skin lesion identification reveal that **______**.\n",
