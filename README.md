# CANCER

## Project Proposal

### Abstract
Primarily, we want to train a model to predict malignancy and type of skin lesions. Skin cancer is a massive issue worldwide and one where machine learning could be used to improve outcomes and accessibility to services. Using images of skin lesions as our dataset, we will use clustering to classify between benign and malignant, as well as differentiating between types of malignant lesions. Catching cancer early, and characterizing the malignancy can make a huge difference in the care provided to patients, and their comfort.

### Motivation and Question


### Planned Deliverables
1. A Jupyter notebook with model development and evaluation process
2. Brief exploration into the availability of skin cancer data for diverse skin tones

### Resources Required
The dataset is publicly available, for free, on the Harvard Dataverse: [Dataset](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/DBW86T)

The dataset is quite large — over 10000 images– so we may need increased computing power via Middlebury’s ADA.

### What You Will Learn

**Zoe Greenwald**
Since my conversation with Phil last semester, one of my goals in taking this class has been to complete an in-depth project using machine learning as a tool to help with cancer diagnosis. One topic we haven’t discussed in depth in class is image classification, so I’m looking forward to combining these two ideas to gain some experience working with different types of vectorization schemes.

**Breanna Guo**
In this final project, while this was not an initial goal of mine, I am interested in learning more about how image classification works. I found the lecture on the topic of kernels fascinating and would love to gain more knowledge on that topic. Additionally, I would like to learn more about cancer. Zoe brought this idea to the group and if we truly are able to classify cancer types, it would be interesting to learn more about the cancer and that it is visually classifiable.

**Liz Rightmire**
I look forward to applying what I’ve learned in this course to an in-depth project. Our idea allows for a deeper dive into specific image-processing techniques, the theory behind classification models, and a social responsibility analysis of a white-dominated dataset. As mentioned in my mid-course reflection, I hope to work on interpersonal, team organization, and presentation skills.

### Risk Statement
First, if the cancer is not able to be classified as malignant or benign through just images, whatever model we run will not work. 

Second, images take up a lot of disk space and while we believe the dataset we chose is compact enough to run on our personal computers, we may need to resort to using the school desktop computers or ADA.

### Ethics Statement
Cancer is a terrible disease that negatively impacts countless people. Our project has the potential to aid people in the early identification of this terrible disease, leading to the best-case scenario: early treatment. It must be noted that our dataset consists mostly of skin cancers shown on light skin tones. Therefore, our model is exclusionary to those with darker skin tones. 
We argue that our project will make the world a better place because:
- The world is a better place when fewer people are sick
- Skin cancers can be identified based on appearance 
- Treatment works best when cancers are detected early, and an automated preliminary screening process will make detections more accessible

### Tentative Timeline

Week 9:Come up with the idea, motivation, and find a dataset. Explore the availability of non-white skin cancer images 

Week 10:Dataset exploration/start analysis: Create a model

Week 11:Evaluate the model: Review analysis bias

Week 12:Final Presentation
