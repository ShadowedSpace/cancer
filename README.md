# CANCER
#### Zoe Greenwald, Breanna Guo, Julia Nerenberg, Liz Rightmire

## Project Proposal

### Abstract


### Motivation and Question


### Planned Deliverables
1. A Jupyter notebook with model development and evaluation process
2. Brief exploration into the availability of skin cancer data for diverse skin tones


### Resources Required
The dataset is publicly available, for free, on the Harvard Dataverse: [Dataset](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/DBW86T)

The dataset is quite large — 1511 images– so we may need increased computing power via Middlebury’s ADA.

### What You Will Learn

**Zoe Greenwald**
Since my conversation with Phil last semester, one of my goals in taking this class has been to complete an in-depth project using machine learning as a tool to help with cancer diagnosis. One topic we haven’t discussed in depth in class is image classification, so I’m looking forward to combining these two ideas to gain some experience working with different types of vectorization schemes.

**Breanna Guo**
In this final project, while this was not an initial goal of mine, I am interested in learning more about how image classification works. I found the lecture on the topic of kernels fascinating and would love to gain more knowledge on that topic. Additionally, I would like to learn more about cancer. Zoe brought this idea to the group and if we truly are able to classify cancer types, it would be interesting to learn more about the cancer and that it is visually classifiable.

**Liz Rightmire**
I look forward to applying what I’ve learned in this course to an in-depth project. Our idea allows for a deeper dive into specific image-processing techniques, the theory behind classification models, and a social responsibility analysis of a white-dominated dataset. As mentioned in my mid-course reflection, I hope to work on interpersonal, team organization, and presentation skills.

### Risk Statement
First, if the cancer is not able to be classified as malignant or benign through just images, whatever model we run will not work. 

Second, images take up a lot of disk space and while we believe the dataset we chose is compact enough to run on our personal computers, we may need to resort to using the school desktop computers or ADA.

### Ethics Statement


### Tentative Timeline

Week 9:Come up with the idea, motivation, and find a dataset. Explore the availability of non-white skin cancer images 

Week 10:Dataset exploration/start analysis: Create a model

Week 11:Evaluate the model: Review analysis bias

Week 12:Final Presentation
