# CANCER

## Project Proposal

### Abstract
We are examining the relationship between skin cancer detection accuracy and skin tone. We will use a dataset of skin cancer images and their associated skin tones to train a model to predict the likelihood of a skin cancer image being correctly classified. We will then use this model to predict the likelihood of a skin cancer image being correctly classified based on skin tone.

### Motivation and Question
Many people assume that skin cancer can only affect individuals with lighter skin tones, however, this is not the case. We want to determine whether this bias is reflected in skin cancer diagnoses. We also want to discover whether this bias is reflected in the accuracy of skin cancer detection models. 

### Planned Deliverables


### Resources Required


### What You Will Learn
I look forward to applying what Iâ€™ve learned in this course to an in-depth project. Our idea allows for a deeper dive into specific image-processing techniques, the theory behind classification models, and a social responsibility analysis of a white-dominated dataset. As mentioned in my mid-course reflection, I hope to work on interpersonal, team organization, and presentation skills.
